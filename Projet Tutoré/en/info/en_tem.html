                <h3><b>Some testimonials from our former students</b></h3>
                <p><b>Damien Lefebvre</b></p>
                <p>
                    Following his bac S, he went to college because it is more supervised, before reorienting himself. <br>
                    Having discovered computer science, he ended up applying to the IUT of Villetaneuse in order to prepare a DUT in Computer Science option Software Engineering in 2002.
                    The acquisition of rigorous working methods, in particular, prompted him to complete his training with the Professional License in Computer Systems and Software, offered by the same IUT.
                <br>
                "The knowledge and skills developed by three years of study of algorithms, basics
                data, but also accounting aspects of the business world, were the key that allowed me
                to be recruited by a large French IT service company, after a 4-month end-of-year internship. ”


                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, he has become a Programmer Analyst and puts his skills at the service of major clients such as renowned banking establishments.

                <p>
                    « My name is Charly PRIVAT, I was 18 when I obtained my STI2D bac option SIN. During which I was introduced to and interested in IT. This is how I looked for training in this area, so I turned to the DUT in IT at the IUT de Lens.
                    <br>
                    IUT taught me the basics of web development and development, as well as databases. The supervision of the teachers is a significant advantage, which makes us bring out the best in ourselves.
                    <br>
                    Today, I have been at IUT for 3 years, and my motivation is only increasing. Indeed, I would like to move towards a professional license or a course going up to bac + 5. »
